# URL Shortener

Experimental repo to play around with tRPC with Next.js. This app simply creates a random string from a URL provided, if it doesn't already exist in the DB. This is invoked using a Next.js serverless function paired with tRPC. Given that the deployed domain is fairly lengthy, you may not actually get a shorter URL. This is fine since the purpose of this app is not to use it as my go-to URL shortener, but as an example of how to use tRPC's powerful features.
